# JavaScript_projectInJuno :octocat:    
  
This project is re uploaded on Sep 12, 2021 because my misusing git and my repository did not work properly. 
   
When I figured out how to fix it, I alreayd empty and reset this document. The cost of learning...  
  
My break timer is built during the second half of Aug (due on Aug 29) then I started working on my second project in Juno JavaScript course, it is about APIs.  
  
After some brainstorms and idea changes (pokedex, hearthstone pack openning simulator, weather recipe... I may build them later), I am building my weather network since I am trying to combine three APIs working together.  
  

## _YUHUI'S BREAK TIMER_:alarm_clock:  
   
Thanks to use Yuhui's break timer! My break timer is a counting down based on user's input: both shortcut click function and number input are allowed.  
  
In addition, users can input the time they want to count down, or the time they want to be alerted (I call it __"Be-back" function__). 
   
I set shortcut buttons for __lunch time__, __work break__, __coffee time__, __pomodoro__, __plus/reduce a min/sec__. 
   
All acts on my app will be logged and they can be marked as important marks.  
  
Three themes could be selected while two languages are provided.  
  
Please feel free to share with me if you have any idea about improving the practicability of this break timer :).
